# Radio-MD

`radio-md` (by `gabru-md`) combines my love for music and technology.
It generates calming music using my instruments, based on the rhythmic patterns I enjoy.

My ukulele is my favorite instrument, and this project brings it to life in code.

### Usage
```sh
python3 radio.py --bpm 165 --narratives 2 --repeat 2 --ui
```
